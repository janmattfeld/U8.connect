### Looking for new friends, work opportunities or a date? Use your commuting time and connect with like-minded people!

## Inspiration
Have you been on a boring subway ride? Yes you have. We all have! Instead of just sitting anonymously among strangers we want the BVG customers to connect: We create the BVG community!

## How it works
Use your BVG app as usual. But additionally we get a little social here. Just tell us what you are open for:
- Just a nice casual chat, please.
- Work opportunities would be great.
- A date <3
- Anything else ...

We take care of connecting you to similar passengers. As you ride we show who's next to you. If you two like, start a chat!

> Additionally you may add a tag line for your current ride, that's a great conversation starter!

## How we built it
Using react-native and a node.js server, we simultaneously built one app for iOS and Android devices. It connects to our (extended) BVG API, allowing us to display real-time status updates and matches.

## What's next for U8.connect?
We'd like to integrate our social service into the official BVG app. That would enrich the commuting time of about 1,7 million BVG customers!
